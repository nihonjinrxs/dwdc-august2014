# SQL, the Sequel
##### SQL on Data Frames and Advanced SQL in a Database

This repository contains materials for [my talk at the Data Wranglers DC meetup on August 6, 2014](), which is a follow-on to [my talk at the Data Wranglers DC meetup on June 4, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Wranglers-DC/events/171768162/).  Materials for that talk are in the GitHub Repo [nihonjinrxs/dwdc-june2014](http://www.github.com/nihonjinrxs/dwdc-june2014).

### Contents
The talk consists of two major directions:
- Using SQL on data frames in R and in Julia
- Using more advanced SQL techniques in a database system (examples in PostgreSQL) to script auto-updating computations

Folders are as follows (content coming soon... this is a work in progress!)
- A slide deck (`./slides`) in Apple Keynote, [PDF](#) and [HTML](#) formats
- An RMarkdown document (`./R`), [published on RPubs](#), that demonstrates using `sqldf` in R to perform SQL queries on data frames as if they are tables
- An iJulia notebook document (`./julia`) that demonstrates using `sqldf` from the `SQLite.jl` package in Julia to perform SQL queries on data frames as if they are tables
- A set of SQL scripts (`./sql`) that create the local PostgreSQL database objects for the second direction

### Where do I start?
I recommend that anyone wishing to understand what I've done should start with [the prior talk materials](http://www.github.com/nihonjinrxs/dwdc-june2014), then tackle these pieces in order, starting with the slide deck.

### Future Work
Given time, I hope to investigate `sqldf` like operations on data structures in Python as well..
